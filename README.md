# Amazon Price Detector

 You tell what product you want and what price you want it to be below and it will email you as soons as the price drops
 below that price point.

 For this project safety API key is kept secret.

 If you want to create API key for yourself, do not hesitate to reach me :)
 
## We use Node.js (nightmare) and sendgrid/mail, dotenv

 We need to open a new file with .env and we will put our API key inside of it for sending emails.
